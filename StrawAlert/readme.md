**StrawAlert: Fighting Dehydration**
In 2013, there were more than 100,000 stationary treatments in Germany resulting in costs of several hundred million euro.

This Android app suggests a method to mitigate this avoidable issue of dehydration in a supervised environment (like hospitals or retirement homes).

It enables the nurse to monitor the patient’s drinking events via a personal straw equipped with a turbine. Each day the nurse reads out the patient’s drinking data via Bluetooth Low Energy and receives immediate response by the app if the ingested amount of liquid was enough, adding each event to the history in a database.

This group project was conducted at a TUM class in cooperation with a TUM start-up.
