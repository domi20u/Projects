# HDR imaging for improving disparity maps

In situations with strong light intensity gradients, conventional cameras fail to display most of the image content. In autonomous driving these situations occur when the pavement reflects the sun rays or when entering/exiting a tunnel.

HDR imaging takes multiple images (here only two) with higher and lower shutter speeds that exposes lighter and darker scenes better. Combining both results in an image that is overall better exposed.
